//it's great to have a seperate class for our constants, to avoid typos and then we export it also
export const authConstants = {

    LOGIN_USER:'LOGIN_USER',
    LOGIN_SUCCESS:'LOGIN_SUCCESS',
    LOGIN_FAILURE:'LOGIN_FAILURE',

    REGISTER_USER:'REGISTER_USER',
    REGISTER_SUCCESS:'REGISTER_SUCCESS',
    REGISTER_FAILURE:'REGISTER_FAILURE'
